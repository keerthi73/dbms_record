            <p>	Same as railway reservation system, airline also needs DBMS to keep records of flights arrival, departure and delay status. It also contains air schedules, fare tarrifs, passenger reservations and ticket records. 
                Airline reservation System is a computerized system used to store and retrieve information and conduct transactions related to air travel. 
                It is projected towards enhancing the relationship between customers and airline agencies through the use of ARSs, and thereby making it convenient for the customers to book the flights as when they require such that they 
                can utilize this software to make reservations. databases facilitate the process of smooth reservation of airline tickets with minimal work on the part of both the customer and the administrators involved . 
                ARS eventually evolved into CRS, (Computer Reservation System)It is used for reservations of a particular airline and it interfaces with a GDS (Global Distribution System) which supports travel agencies and other distribution 
                channels in making reservations for most major airlines in a single system.
